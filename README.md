# Learning-Javascript
Storage of random javascript files I make while learning how to use it.
Self-taught using [freeCodeCamp.org's tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkZNo7MFNFg).

## Progress
**Last got up to 31:10 - Length of a String**

## Notes
Not every single step is going to be outlined here.
Some steps will be merged with other files.
